**SimpleMoney** bridges the gap between resource gathering and a high-tier economy. Forget Emeralds—the **Money Bill** is the new standard for wealth. You can't just farm it; you must craft it, find it, or earn it.

## ✨ Features at a Glance

* **🏭 Complex Economy:** Money isn't free. Creating a bill is an industrial process involving rare materials, Smithing Tables, and Blast Furnaces.
* **⚖️ Better Villagers:** Trading is now based on a weighted probability system. Rare enchants like **Mending** are harder to find but guaranteed at specific levels.
* **🕵️ Black Market:** The Wandering Trader is finally useful! He now sells non-renewable items like **Netherite Scrap** and **Shulker Shells**.
* **🌍 Exploration Loot:** Money Bills have been injected into Shipwrecks, Strongholds, and Buried Treasure.
* **⏱️ Vault Cooldowns:** Prevents infinite looting by adding a configurable cooldown to Vaults (Default: 100 Days).

## 🛠️ The Production Chain
Creating currency requires chemistry, precision, and heat. From **Special Paper** to **Blast Furnace Curing**, every Money Bill is a crafted masterpiece.
