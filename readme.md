**(Mod ID: `simplemoney` / `simplebuilding`)**

**SimpleMoney** creates a bridge between resource gathering, exploration, and a high-tier villager economy. It introduces the **Money Bill**, a currency that is significantly more valuable than Emeralds. You can't just farm it easily—you must craft it using rare materials, find it in hidden treasures, or earn it by selling Diamonds to master smiths.
## ✨ Key Features
* **Complex Crafting Chain:** Money isn't free. Creating a bill requires Diamonds, Amethyst, Phantom Membranes, and a Smithing Table.
* **Weighted Enchantment System:** Villagers now offer enchanted gear and books based on a custom probability pool. Rare enchantments like **Mending** or **Protection IV** are harder to find but guaranteed at specific trading levels.
* **Black Market Trader:** The Wandering Trader is no longer useless! He has a chance to sell non-renewable or rare resources like **Netherite Scrap** and **Shulker Shells** using a randomized pool system.
* **Loot Integration:** Find bills in Shipwrecks, Strongholds, and Buried Treasure.

## 🤝 The Economy Overhaul

The **Money Bill** is worth approximately **5 Emeralds**, but it buys things Emeralds cannot easily obtain.

### 🏛️ Villager Professions
Villagers now use a **weighted system** for enchantments. Instead of random noise, trades are curated for their profession level.

![Trades](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/8493703719c030f6f07c6634426611685e6fae6e.png)

* **Armorer (Expert/Master):** Sells **Diamond Armor** with high-tier enchants (e.g., 40% chance for *Protection II*, rare chance for *Protection IV*). **Buys Diamonds** for Bills.
* **Toolsmith (Master):** Sells **Enchanted Diamond Tools**. Chance for *Efficiency V* or *Fortune III*. **Buys Diamonds** for Bills.
* **Librarian (All Levels):** Sells **Enchanted Books**. Higher levels unlock pools containing *Mending*, *Infinity*, and *Swift Sneak*. Also sells **Name Tags**.
* **Cleric (Novice):** Sells **Ender Pearls** in bulk (8-12 per Bill).
* **Fletcher (Apprentice):** Sells **Firework Rockets** in bulk (16-32 per Bill).
* **Farmer (Apprentice):** Sells **Golden Carrots** and **Cakes**.
* **Mason (Novice):** Sells **Building Blocks** (Stone/Deepslate) in stacks.

### 🦙 The Wandering Trader (RNG)
The Wandering Trader has random pools of items. He doesn't always sell the same thing!
* **Common Pool (~30%):** Chorus Fruits, Apples.
* **Rare Pool (~10%):** **Netherite Scrap**, Diamond Ores.
* **Legendary Pool (~5%):** **Shulker Shells** (Expensive!).
